### Hey you 👋

**I'm a developer** at Becklyn Studios in Ludwigsburg.  
During my spare time I like to create awesome apps & services,  
of which you can find a selection pinned below,  
other stuff can be found in the `Repositories` tab.   

#### Technologies
I know a fair bit of technologies and languages already  
and am always curious to experiment with some new ones

- 🖼 Vue.js
- ⚛️ React
- 🅰️ Angular
- 🧰 .Net Core
- 🏝 Kotlin
- 🏙 TypeScript
- 🦦 Go
- 🧭 Kubernetes
- 🐳 Docker

The ones that are in *italics*, I have not used recently (the last quarter of the year)  
and probably need some practice before using them again.
