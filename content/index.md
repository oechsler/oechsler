#greeting
Hi there 👋, I am 

#name
Sam

::part
I'm a backend developer at [Becklyn Studios](https://becklyn.com) in Ludwigsburg.
I also do stuff part-time for [CodeEffect](https://codeeffect.io/) in Pforzheim.

In my spare time I like to 👨‍💻&nbsp;code and if there is any time left 🕹&nbsp;play games &minus;&nbsp;who doesn't?

If you want to see how it's made or just something that has a little more spice to it than my website do not hesitate:
