Hi, I'm Sam. Currently, I'm a computer science student at the Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) 
in Karlsruhe. Prior to that I've been dreaming in code since pretty much the beginning of the last decade and thus have
gained roughly eight years now of *personal experience* in coding with various technologies and languages, something I 
always like to dedicate some of my free time to. Whilst studying I have also gained roughly two years of experience in 
the industry now working at medialesson GmbH in Pforzheim.
