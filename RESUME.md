# Resume

Hi, I'm Sam. Currently, I'm with Mercedes Benz AG building software as a developer.
I graduated from Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) in Karlsruhe in 2021 and earned a bachelor's degree in computer science (B.Sc.). 

Prior to that, I've been dreaming in code since pretty much the beginning of the last decade and thus have gained roughly a decade now of *personal experience* in coding with various technologies and languages, something I always like to dedicate some of my free time to. Whilst studying, I also gained roughly two years of experience in the industry.
