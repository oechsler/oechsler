Hi, I'm Sam. Currently, I'm with Becklyn Studios in Ludwigsburg building software as a Backend Developer.
I recently graduated from Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) in Karlsruhe and earned a bachelors degree in computer science (B.Sc.). Prior to that I've been dreaming in code since pretty much the beginning of the last decade and thus have
gained roughly eight years now of *personal experience* in coding with various technologies and languages, something I 
always like to dedicate some of my free time to. Whilst studying I have also gained roughly two years of experience in 
the industry now.
